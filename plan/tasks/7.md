# Task 7 — Session Brain skill UX (SKILL.md + optional slash command)

## Goal

Turn the Session Brain implementation into a usable Claude Code Skill with clear triggers and progressive disclosure.

## Deliverables

- `skills/session-brain/SKILL.md`
  - YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`
  - explicit trigger phrases (per `docs/voyager.md`)
  - concise body (< ~500 lines) that points to `reference.md` + schemas/prompts as needed
- Optional: `commands/brain.md`
  - simple command prompt that tells Claude to use Session Brain skill behaviors

## Acceptance criteria

- Skill description reliably triggers on “resume”, “what were we doing”, “remember this decision”, etc.
- Skill body teaches where `.claude/voyager/*` lives and how to use it without requiring hook internals.
- Dogfood: after this task, use Session Brain to track the remaining implementation work *in this repo* (record decisions, open questions, and “what’s next” into `./.claude/voyager/`).
