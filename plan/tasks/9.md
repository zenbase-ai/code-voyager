# Task 9 — Repo Curriculum Planner skill UX (SKILL.md + optional slash command)

## Goal

Expose the planner as a Claude Code skill that can answer “what should I work on next?” and optionally materialize plans into files.

## Deliverables

- `skills/curriculum-planner/SKILL.md`
  - triggers per `docs/voyager.md`
  - `allowed-tools` default Read/Grep/Glob/Bash (Write only when explicitly asked)
- Optional: `commands/curriculum.md`

## Acceptance criteria

- Skill clearly differentiates “propose plan in chat” vs “write plan artifacts to `.claude/voyager/`”.
- Skill points to the on-disk plan artifacts and how to refresh them.
- Dogfood: generate a curriculum for this repo that sequences the remaining tasks in `plan/tasks/` and write it to `./.claude/voyager/curriculum.json`.
