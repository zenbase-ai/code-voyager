# Task 11 — Skill Factory skill UX (SKILL.md + optional slash command)

## Goal

Make Skill Factory usable from chat (“turn this workflow into a skill”) and integrate with the scaffold scripts.

## Deliverables

- `skills/skill-factory/SKILL.md`
  - triggers per `docs/voyager.md`
  - allowed tools include Write/Edit (needed for scaffolding)
- Optional: `commands/factory.md`

## Acceptance criteria

- Skill teaches a safe two-step loop:
  1) propose 3–5 candidate skills
  2) scaffold only the user-selected one
- Dogfood: propose at least one new skill relevant to building/maintaining this repo (e.g., “hook fixture authoring”, “plugin packaging”), then scaffold exactly one into `./.claude/skills/generated/`.
