# Task 8 — Repo Curriculum Planner engine (plan artifacts)

## Goal

Implement curriculum planning from `brain.json` + repo snapshot, producing a structured backlog with acceptance criteria and verification commands.

## Deliverables

- Skill folder: `skills/curriculum-planner/`
  - `schemas/curriculum.schema.json` (goal, tracks, tasks, metadata)
  - `prompts/plan_curriculum.prompt.md`
  - `reference.md` (how to customize goals/tracks)
- Scripts:
  - `scripts/curriculum/plan.py`
    - reads brain + snapshot
    - invokes LLM (Task 3)
    - writes `.claude/voyager/curriculum.json` + `.claude/voyager/curriculum.md`

## Acceptance criteria

- Produced tasks include: `why`, `estimated_scope`, `acceptance_criteria`, `suggested_files`, `commands_to_run`.
- Planner avoids stack-specific hardcoding (LLM infers stack from snapshot).
- Output is deterministic-ish: same inputs yield similar structure (prompt enforces shape).
- Dogfood: running the planner in this repo produces a curriculum that correctly references `docs/`, `plan/`, and the plugin/package work needed to finish the 5 skills.
