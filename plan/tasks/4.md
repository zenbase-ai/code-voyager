# Task 4 — Repo snapshot (“cheap, high-signal, language-agnostic”)

## Goal

Produce a fast repo snapshot used by Session Brain + Curriculum Planner, without hardcoding stack-specific logic.

## Deliverables

- `src/voyager/repo/snapshot.py`
  - collects:
    - git status (porcelain), current branch, recent commits (short)
    - top-level file list + directory summary (bounded)
    - quick “how to run” hints from common docs (bounded grep in `README*`, `CONTRIBUTING*`, `Makefile`, etc.)
  - outputs a compact JSON object
- `scripts/repo/snapshot.py` (CLI/script entry used by hooks and planners)

## Acceptance criteria

- Runs in < ~2s on a medium repo (no full tree walk unless bounded).
- Works when git is unavailable (still returns partial snapshot).
- Output is stable and bounded (no megabytes).
- Dogfood: running the snapshot against this repo includes high-signal hints (e.g., sees `pyproject.toml`, `docs/`, `plan/`) and produces a compact JSON blob suitable for context injection.
